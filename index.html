            <p>Hello! I'm Nozib, a passionate software engineer. I design and develop web applications. You might saw me
                jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development
                Hero.
